- reset terminal:
	- to clear all or not to clear all, that is the question...
	- update manpage and readme
- icon-title setting?
- look at DBus sessions
- overwrite config dialog:
	- works correctly with CTRL-SHIFT-Q, but not with window button...


Non-Goals:
----------
* allow output with "-o" to "-", or stdout
