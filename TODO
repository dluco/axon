- resize method?
- use a top-level struct to hold:
	- Config
	- Options
	- g_ptr_array of all Terminals
- redo config file handling:
	- look for:
		~/.config/axon/axonrc
		/etc/axon/axonrc
		(fallback to defaults)
	- config file does not have to have all settings
	- don't write to config file (ever)
